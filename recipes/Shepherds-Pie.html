        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <p>A new healthier take on traditional Shepherds Pie using ground chicken instead of ground beef. All the flavor and none of the grease!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>

            <li>1 pound ground 85% lean chicken</li>
            <li>5 russet potatoes</li>
            <li>3 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 finely chopped onion</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
            <li>2 tbs parsley flakes</li>
            <li>1 tbsp garlic salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp onion powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
            <li>2 tsp ground thyme</li>
            <li>2 tsp salt divided</li>
            <li>2 tsp pepper divided</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>1. Cut the potatoes into 2" chunks. You can peel them or leave the peel on</li>
            <li>2. Bring 5 cups of water to a roiling bowl. Place cut potatoes into pot and cover stirring often. Remove when they are fork tender</li>
            <li>3. In a large frying pan cook the brown chicken until there is no pink visible. Use the 85% lean chicken to add flavor and moisture to the dish</li>
            <li>4. In the frying pan add the onion, garlic salt, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, thyme, parsley and 1 tsp each of the salt and pepper to the ground chicken.</li>
            <li>5. Mash the boiled potatoes adding the remaining salt and pepper. Mash them into a smooth but stiff consistency. The potatoes will make a peak when done.</li>
            <li>6. In a 4 quart ceramic or glass baking dish layer the ground chicken, then the cheese and finally the potatoes</li>
            <li>Place the baking dish in a 350 degree oven for 25 minutes covered. Remove the cover in the last 5 minutes to lightly brown the potatoes</li>
            <li>Remove from oven and serve. Refrigerate any leftovers</li>
        </ol>
